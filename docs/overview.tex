Payment channels allow participants to make repeated transfers of ether without using transactions.
In this project, I will build a long-lived unidirectional payment channel between two participants.
The usage of the proposed payment channel consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sender opens a payment channel by deploys the smart contract with ether.
    \item The sender signs payment messages that specify the amount of ether owed to the receiver.
    \item The sender adds more amount of ether to the smart contract.
    \item The receiver withdraws ether as needed before closing the channel.
    \item The receiver closes the payment channel, withdrawing its authorized amount of ether and sending the remainder
    back to the sender.
    \item The sender initiates the closure of channel to retrieve unspent funds in a timeframe.
\end{itemize}
