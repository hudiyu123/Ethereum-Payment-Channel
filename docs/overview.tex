Payment channels allow participants to make safe, off-chain transfers while avoiding per-transfer Ethereum transaction
fees.
In this project, I built a long-lived unidirectional payment channel between two parties.
The operations of the payment channel include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sender opens a payment channel by deploys the smart contract with ether.
    \item The sender signs payment messages that specify the amount of ether owed to the receiver.
    \item The sender adds more amount of ether to the smart contract.
    \item The receiver withdraws ether as needed without closing the channel.
    \item The receiver closes the payment channel, withdrawing its authorized amount of ether and sending the remainder
    back to the sender.
    \item The sender initiates the closure of channel to retrieve unspent funds in a timeframe.
\end{itemize}
